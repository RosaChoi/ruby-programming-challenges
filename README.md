# Temperature Converter

Create a simple temperature converter. It should function like the example below:

Type '1' to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or type '2' to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

Example:
1
Enter Celsius Temperature:
24
24 degrees Celsius is equal to 75.2 degree Fahrenheit

# Odd Numbers

Write code to print all the odd numbers between 1 and 1337

# Guessing Game

Create a program that picks a random number between 1 and 100 and then asks the user to guess the number. Once the user guesses a number, the program should say, higher, lower, or tell the user that they got the number correct. The user should continue to make guesses until he guesses correctly. Also, once the user guesses correctly, the program should print the number of guesses needed to arrive at the correct answer. Below is sample output:

Guess a number between 1 and 100
50
The number is lower than 50.  Guess again
25
The number is lower than 25.  Guess again
13
The number is higher than 13.  Guess again
20
The number is lower than 20.  Guess again
17
The number is higher than 17.  Guess again
18
The number is higher than 18.  Guess again
19
You got it in 7 tries

# Simple Ascii Art

Part 1
Using loops (don't just use a bunch of puts statements!), print out a simple ascii art triangle like the one below:

Part 2
Ask the user for the number of rows and the ascii character that the pyramid should consist of Here's an example:

# Reverse A String

Reverse a string in place. In other words, do not create a new string or use other methods on the string such as reverse. The goal of the problem is to use a loop and the string accessors to figure out which values to swap for other values. Below is the output.

Enter a string:
  reverse_me
em_esrever

# Prime Numbers

Write a method called prime_printer(max) which takes one integer argument. It should print out all the prime numbers between 0 and the given argument.
